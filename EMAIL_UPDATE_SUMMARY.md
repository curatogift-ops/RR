2. Go to your website

## About the App Password

**App Password:** `yfyx xqok acfn thdu`

**NOT USED** - FormSubmit.co doesn't require SMTP authentication. This password would only be needed if you were using:
- Gmail SMTP server directly
- Node.js backend with Nodemailer
- Custom email server

Since we're using FormSubmit.co (serverless), no password needed!

## Spam Prevention Tips

After verification, to prevent emails going to spam:

1. **Mark as "Not Spam"** when first email arrives
2. **Add to contacts:** Add `noreply@formsubmit.co` to Gmail contacts
3. **Create filter:**
   - Gmail Settings → Filters → Create new
   - From: `noreply@formsubmit.co`
   - Action: "Never send to Spam"
   - Label: "Form Submissions"
